I had a chance to work for small and big companies in different industries all around the world (Canada/US/France/New Zealand/Switzerland) and this by helping them, designing, implementing and submitting their products.

During these last 14 years, I was able to build strong experiences in Back-end and Front-end development which helped me to act as mobile and fullStack developer, team lead and CTO.
